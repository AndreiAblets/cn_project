I am excited to see all of us build stronger relationships with each other and hope you'll join.\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\nYou sign up, match yourself with a partner, and get helpful conversation starters each week so you get to know each other better. It's up to you how much time you want to spend together and what goals you want to work towards.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fbmentorship/signup/?application_id=1366267283538739",
